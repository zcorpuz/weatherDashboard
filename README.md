# weatherDashboard

Weather Dashboard is a weather application that allows you to input any city in the world. The application will display the current weather of that city and also give you a 5 day weather forecast for the same city. Icons will pop up to signify the weather. The UV index is color coded to the UV spectrum.

## Contributing

## RoadMap

In future updates, I will want to clean UI up as well as have the appliation display current location of the user on the dashboard when the document loads.

## Acknowledgement

I would like to shout out Alek Valencia, CJ Pia, and Carmen Obied for collaborating on ideas and helping with troubleshooting.
